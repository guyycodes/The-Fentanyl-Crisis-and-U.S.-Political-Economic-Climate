# The Fentanyl Crisis and U.S. Political-Economic Climate

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of how the U.S. political and economic climate has contributed to the fentanyl crisis, examining the complex interplay between policy decisions, economic factors, healthcare access, and social conditions that have fueled America's deadliest drug epidemic.

**Live Site:** [The Fentanyl Crisis and U.S. Political-Economic Climate](https://guyycodes.github.io/The-Fentanyl-Crisis-and-U.S.-Political-Economic-Climate/)

## Key Topics Covered

- **Evolution of the Opioid Crisis (2000s-2025)**: Tracing the three waves of the epidemic from prescription painkillers to heroin to synthetic fentanyl
- **Political Factors**: How regulatory decisions, legislation, and policy responses shaped the crisis
- **Economic Inequality**: The connection between "deaths of despair," community economic decline, and opioid addiction
- **Healthcare Access**: The critical role of treatment accessibility and the impact of healthcare policies like Medicaid expansion
- **Social Determinants**: How community factors, stigma, and social isolation contribute to addiction vulnerability

## Research Findings

The analysis reveals that the fentanyl crisis stems from a confluence of systemic failures:

- Regions with higher poverty and unemployment face higher opioid overdose rates
- Political decisions like weak pharmaceutical regulation significantly exacerbated the crisis
- Only about 22% of Americans with opioid use disorder receive appropriate medication treatment
- States that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act saw approximately 6% lower increases in overdose deaths
